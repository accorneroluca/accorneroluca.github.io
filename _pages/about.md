I am a differential geometer. My main areas of expertise are the theory of Lie groupoids and multiplicative structures, Poisson and Jacobi geometry, and the geometry of PDEs. I am also interested in the the topology of hyperplane fields on manifolds. 

I earned my Ph.D from Universiteit Utrecht, under the supervision of Marius Crainic.
