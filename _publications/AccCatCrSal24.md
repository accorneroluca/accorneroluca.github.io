excerpt: "This is a book describing a modern approach to the theory of Lie pseudogroups and geometric structure on manifolds that builds upon the theory of Lie groupoids, principal groupoid actions, and multiplicative structures. The main achievements include a clarification of the foundations of Élie Cartan's work on the subject and a framework capable of dealing with non transitive pseudogroups."
